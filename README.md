## Instructions

To run, start index.html in any modern javascript enabled browser.

Arrow keys to move.

When you encounter the **river**, you are reset back to the _center_ of the bottom row.

If you are attacked by a **VW Beetle**, you are reset to a _corner_.

See how many times you can hit the river without being mangled!
